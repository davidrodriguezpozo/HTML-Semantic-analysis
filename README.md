# HTML-Semantic-analysis

## In this project one can find a semantic analysis of [Alexa's UK top 50 most visited sites of 2020](https://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/GB)  

### This analysis consits on an initial fetch of the data, and manipulation of the websites in order to retrieve all the desired information. 

As an initial approach, the HTML tags and wordocunts are analysed, and compared, in order to be able to extract some results.

Finally, an TF-IDF (NLP) analysisi is done in the websites, so one may know which websites are more similar by the frequency of each word that appears in the website.
